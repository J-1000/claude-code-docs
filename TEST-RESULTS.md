## Key Fixes Verified

1. **Path Detection**: Successfully found installations from both v0.1 and v0.2 configs
2. **Clean Removal**: Old installations were removed (no "preserved" messages)
3. **Branch Handling**: No git errors during updates
4. **Template File**: Successfully found and installed from dev branch
5. **Cleanup Order**: Old paths captured before config updates

## Summary

All migration tests passed successfully! The v0.3 installer correctly:
- Detects old installations from configuration files
- Migrates to the new fixed location
- Removes old installations when they have no changes
- Updates all configuration properly

Ready for user testing and merge to main.
