# Claude Code Docs v0.3 Implementation Status

## Current Status
- **Branch**: dev-v0.3-refactor
- **Location**: ~/.claude-code-docs (migrated from ~/Projects/tmp/claude-code-docs)
- **Date**: 2025-01-30

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ
1. Created claude-docs-helper.sh.template with all core functionality
2. Implemented migration detection and auto-cleanup in install.sh
3. Fixed installation to use ~/.claude-code-docs location
4. Added migration info file support
5. Simplified docs.md command to just execute helper script
6. Implemented whats-new feature
7. Updated all documentation (README, UNINSTALL.md)
8. Tested migration - it works but deleted our dev directory!

## Current Issues üêõ
1. **Negative timestamp bug**: Shows "Documentation last updated on GitHub: -158 minutes ago"
   - Date parsing failing for ISO format timestamps
   - Need to fix in claude-docs-helper.sh.template

2. **What's new shows wrong commits**: Shows our dev commits instead of doc updates
   - Should filter for "Update Claude Code docs" commits only
   - Should only show changes in docs/ directory

3. **Working directory issue**: Migration deleted our dev directory
   - Need to push dev branch to GitHub
   - Clone to new dev directory

## Next Steps üìã
1. **URGENT**: Push dev-v0.3-refactor to GitHub for backup
2. Set up new dev directory at ~/Projects/tmp/claude-code-docs-dev
3. Fix the date parsing bug in helper script
4. Fix whats-new to filter for actual doc updates
5. Test remaining functionality:
   - v0.2 ‚Üí v0.3 auto-update (requires setting installer_version to 0.3)
   - Uninstaller from any directory
   - Hook auto-update functionality

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Push dev branch and set up new dev dir
cd ~/.claude-code-docs
git remote add origin https://github.com/ericbuess/claude-code-docs.git
git push -u origin dev-v0.3-refactor

cd ~/Projects/tmp
git clone https://github.com/ericbuess/claude-code-docs.git claude-code-docs-dev
cd claude-code-docs-dev
git checkout dev-v0.3-refactor
```

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Fresh installation to ~/.claude-code-docs
- [x] Migration from existing installation
