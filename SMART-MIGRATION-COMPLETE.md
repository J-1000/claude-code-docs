# Smart Migration Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Version Dependencies
- No more version checking anywhere in the code
- Works with any version of claude-code-docs
- Simpler, more maintainable

### 2. Smart Installation Discovery
Instead of guessing directories, now reads actual configs:
- Checks `~/.claude/commands/docs.md` for Execute paths
- Checks `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks for paths
- Extracts and verifies actual installation locations

### 3. Simplified Migration
- Always preserves old installations
- Shows user where old installation is
- Let's user decide if they want to remove it
- No complex file detection logic

### 4. Smart Uninstaller
- Dynamically finds ALL installations
- Uses `git status --porcelain` for safe removal
- Only removes clean git repos automatically
- Preserves any directory with changes or non-git

## Key Changes

### install.sh
- Removed 40+ lines of `detect_user_modifications()`
- Replaced directory guessing with config reading
- Simplified migration to always preserve

### uninstall.sh
- Complete rewrite (130 lines)
- Dynamic discovery from configs
- Safe removal with git status checks
- No assumptions about location

### claude-docs-helper.sh.template
- Removed migration notice logic
- Cleaner, simpler code

## Example Output

### During Migration:
```
üì¶ Migrating from: /home/user/Projects/claude-code-docs
   To: /home/user/.claude-code-docs

‚úÖ Migration complete!

‚ÑπÔ∏è  Your old installation is preserved at:
   /home/user/Projects/claude-code-docs

   To remove it, run:
   rm -rf "/home/user/Projects/claude-code-docs"
```

### During Uninstall:
```
Found installations at:
  üìÅ /home/user/.claude-code-docs
  üìÅ /home/user/old-claude-code-docs

‚úì Removed /home/user/.claude-code-docs (clean git repo)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Preserved /home/user/old-claude-code-docs (has uncommitted changes)
```

## Testing

The path extraction handles:
- `Execute: cd /path/claude-code-docs && ...`
- `Execute: /path/claude-code-docs/script.sh`
- `Execute: ~/claude-code-docs/script.sh "$ARGUMENTS"`
- Complex hook commands with embedded paths

## Benefits

1. **No Version Dependencies** - Works with any version
2. **Accurate Discovery** - Uses actual configuration
3. **Safe by Default** - Never deletes user data without checking
4. **Complete Cleanup** - Finds all installations
5. **Simple & Maintainable** - Much less complex code

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
